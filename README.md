# get-the-ZEN-out-of-KAIZEN
Zen – the word conjures images of meditation, peace, tranquility and balance. It’s a great state to be in, but it doesn’t happen by chance. It needs a bit of Kaizen to find Zen!

So what is Kaizen? Kaizen represents our efforts to change from our current state to a good state... It’s a simple philosophy, and it is not rocket science.

Kaizen doesn’t happen in a vacuum. There should be a need – a desire to improve. A sentence that captures that need is a great starting point for a Kaizen event.

You do not need to be a CEO to sponsor a Kaizen event – any supervisor or team lead can make this happen. It doesn’t need much resources, expect for the time & effort of team members.

Holding a Kaizen event involves a few simple steps. See file 'Simplified Kaizen event' 

Remember – Kaizen is about short steps to improve & get to a better state. Trying to get everything accomplished at the first go is the biggest bane of a Kaizen event. Topics that will help improve from your current state – but which requires longer time; large investment or significant effort – these will come up during your brainstorming sessions. But instead of spinning your wheel to get the toughest stuff done, keep them in a parking lot. And focus on the low hanging fruits.

Keep it simple, and your Kaizen event will be a success!
