Identify the need (a sentence that captures the pain and the need would be a great starting point for Kaizen)
Put together a small team (folks involved in the current state)
Bring the team together for a Kaizen event - and enjoy these activities with the team

1. Introduce concept to Kaizen team / set expectations / train on the Kaizen process
2. Document current state / value stream map / identify wastes 
3. Analyze current state / identify root cause / brainstorm solutions / Future state design 
4. Implement improvement / Simulate new process / check reality
5. Establish standard work practice / train on new processes
6. Monitor progress / calculate benefits

Once the new process is stable, and if there is a need to improve - do another Kaizen event!
